# Accept Payment

Hi, welcome to Flip for Business Accept Payment API!

Flip will help you to accept payment from your customers. We provide a redirection payment flow via payment link. Your customer can pay with Flip using various payment methods, like Bank Transfer and Virtual Account. See the end customer transaction flow in our live demo here [https://business.flip.id/accept-payment-landing#demo](https://business.flip.id/accept-payment-landing#demo).

All payment links, payment transactions, and/or the details can be monitored through the Flip for Business dashboard and various API endpoints.
